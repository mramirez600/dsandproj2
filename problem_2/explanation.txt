Problem 2: File Recursion
Explanation

I used recursion and concatenated each new valid file found to current path, then returned the new files found and extended the current list of files with them. This accumulates the list of valid files across sub-directories.

Time and Sapce Complexity are O(n^2) since location of the file depends on the size and depth of the file system.
